# Random-Shell-Scripts
Just some random shell scripts I've written till yet.
#####################
List:
1) backup_files.sh : This shell script takes multiple input filenames as arguments and copies them to a "backup_directory" and prints logs to another file
2) run_maven_commands_in_loop : This script runs the selected maven related command the number of times the user wants to by taking an input integer from the user. Just keep this script in the same folder as your maven project.
